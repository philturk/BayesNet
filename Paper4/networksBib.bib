  abstract = {Modeling of dynamic networks � networks that evolve over time � has
	manifold applications in many fields. In epidemiology in particular,
	there is a need for data-driven modeling of human sexual relationship
	networks for the purpose of modeling and simulation of the spread
	of sexually transmitted disease. Dynamic network data about such
	networks are extremely difficult to collect, however, and much more
	readily available are egocentrically sampled data of a network at
	a single time point, with some attendant information about the sexual
	history of respondents.
	
	Krivitsky and Handcock (2010) proposed a Separable Temporal ERGM (STERGM)
	framework, which facilitates separable modeling of the tie duration
	distributions and the structural dynamics of tie formation. In this
	work, we apply this modeling framework to this problem, by studying
	the long-run properties of STERGM processes, developing methods for
	fitting STERGMs to egocentrically sampled data, and extending the
	network size adjustment method of Krivitsky, Handcock, and Morris
	(2011) to dynamic models.},
