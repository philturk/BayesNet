# Component Distribution for Simulated Genetic Networks

<!-- nice explanation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8q7_sXQ8Rs -->
note to self - do we have enough between group separation to justify (intraclass correlation coeff)
what does "intercept only model" mean in our case

## Mixed Model

- Outstanding: do visuals for posterior checks (did a plot for one - interpret? seems quite bad haha)
- based on residual exponential decay not fitting -- but the smoothness across sampling rate is promising
- do expansion before trying to fit #done need to load and model

not sure what's relevant for mixed model

-sizes of each cluster is y, intercept only... estimate yule-simon... not assuming it varies with covariate... or could pile together and have sampling rate as x value (but would need to understand model better because knowing that's useful)
-use predict to see (and find any diagnostic plots for vglm - see if there's patterns, etc - check package doc, software paper).. power law might not be accurate depending how end trails off
-vglm help file to help for that (or the package file)
-give understanding of yule-simon family next meeting (what is a vglm, etc) & how it relates to glm/what i've seen already

- what is this error that geom_smooth removed non-finite values
- model_lm = glm(abs(jitter(value))~X,family=Gamma(link="log"), data=df) <-- did not converge?
- model_true = glm(abs(jitter(x))~X,family=Gamma(link="log"), data=true_dist_1)
 <- also did not converge
 - Note there are lots of warnings but I hid them
 
 - log scale on y axis (prob most of change is in tails which is currently hard to see )
 - exponential (decay maybe overspursed) - do we see consistent across sampling rates (how parameters change)... if a glm isn't converging can increase the # of iterations that it runs (could need more time)
- include a random effect
- *Note: Each simulation within one proportion has its own random effect.*
- what is the model form we want (quasipoisson, vs glmer with random effect b/c correlated between sims), sledgehammer - if it were exponential what would the rate param be... try a few diff ones (can get form for mle - if this were gamma (for alpha beta what would it be) - if I plot over my data... 
-for component dist ppl often use power law distribution yule-simon dist (how to estimate params for this - or write optimizer) -- if none of the standard ones handle it well it's one of the few that follows this log-log (versus just the log in the others we're looking at)... how does shape change with log y only, how does shape change with log y and log x

- is there a poisson for size and number of times that size occurred - doesn't look like we can do for glm
- what we can do to expand (637 becomes 637 rows with 1, X1, 1)... ex: some function will do that (maybe "expand") (b/c we want each draw to be one cluster - what size is it)
- then fit with just intercept term... x is a function of 1 + (1|variable)... single poisson with extra variability from diff simulations ... 
- if this doesn't work can try the Yule-Simon (see if there's an implementation in R) 

- big question after will be how to move parameters in this situation into bigger epidemic model
